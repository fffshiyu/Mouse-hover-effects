Move Mouse Hover Effects
This project creates a dynamic and visually appealing effect when you hover the mouse over an image. It uses CSS and JavaScript to animate squares over the image and blend them with the image's overlay, creating a unique hover experience.

Features:
Hover Effects: As you move the mouse over the image, squares appear and interact with the image to create a dynamic effect.
Smooth Transitions: CSS transitions allow for smooth animations when the squares fade in and out.
Interactive Grid: A grid of squares moves and reacts based on mouse movement, making the effect more interactive.
Technologies Used:
HTML5: For structuring the content.
CSS3: For styling and animation of hover effects.
JavaScript: To handle user interaction with mouse movements.
How It Works:
HTML Structure: The layout consists of an image container with an overlay grid of squares.
CSS Styling: The image is styled to cover the container, and the grid of squares is overlaid on top. The opacity and blend mode of the squares change based on mouse interaction.
JavaScript Interactivity: The JavaScript detects mouse movement over the image and applies active states to squares, creating the dynamic hover effect.
